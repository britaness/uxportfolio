  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <h2>BestBouquet is a concept that I developed for a tool that provides bouquet suggestions for a variety of occasions.</h2>

  <div class="contentContainer" id="background">
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h4>I took inspiration from a project discussed in <em>UX Strategy</em> (by Jaime Levy). She used http://itsthisforthat.com/ to come up with an idea for a value proposition (“Airbnb for Weddings”). When I tried out the site, I got “1-800 Flowers for Funeral Homes.” I decided to look up 1-800 Flowers to see if the value proposition had any merit. After visiting 1800flowers.com, I felt overwhelmed by the number of options available and imagined that if I were shopping for flowers for a funeral, I would want more direction. From there, I thought to create an app that would provide helpful suggestions for customers shopping for bouquets, and focused on a user flow for purchasing a bouquet for a funeral. <br><br> I also borrowed some inspiration from BuzzFeed quizzes because they are engaging, and if used in an ecommerce environment, they have a tremendous potential to drive traffic by directing shoppers to products that fit their needs and preferences.

  <h3>Concepting</h3>
  <h4>The concept for BestBouquet grew from the understanding that different flowers and flower arrangements have different meanings in different contexts and cultures. From there, I imagined the following scenario:</h4>
  <br>
  <h4><em>Imagine a close friend passed away and you want to buy flowers for the funeral. You start by doing a Google search and find so many bouquets of different types, sizes, and prices. You dig a little deeper and learn that specific flowers have different meanings in different cultures. Your friend is of a different religious and cultural background than you, and you are worried about buying the wrong bouquet. You wonder if it is even appropriate for you to buy flowers for the service. You want to pay your heartfelt respects, and would like some quick advice on what bouquet to buy without needing to research the meanings of different flowers or go to the florist.</em></h4>
  <br>
  <h4>With this scenario in mind, I began sketching:</h4>

<div class="contentContainer" id="competitiveAnalysis">
  <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
  <h4>After coming up with the basic concept for BestBouquet, I wanted to get a sense of what competition exists and to analyze how they solve for the same or similar problems. I discovered Gwyn - 1800flowers.com's current AI software that aims to help customers find the perfect product. Because I was focusing on the customer journey of finding flowers for a funeral, I tested Gwyn to see what she would suggest. After asking me several questions, she ended up providing me with a number to call to talk to an expert. As a pretend customer, this felt a lot like calling a service and being repeatedly transferred to different departments, each falsely promising to have the capacity to solve my problem. I hypothesized that exploring more of a quizlike model that takes a list of products and effectively narrows suggestions based on customers' responses to multiple-choice questions could be equally, if not more effective than an AI-based tool.
<br><br>
    If I were to expand this portion of the project, I would focus on learning more about how and why people discover and buy bouquets and to design around those findings rather than moving quickly through concepting, sketching, and competitive analysis. However, because this project was part of my Prototyping and Testing class at SVC, I needed to quickly move into creating low-fidelity prototypes to test.</h4>
