  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <h2>BestBouquet is a concept that I developed for a tool that provides bouquet suggestions for a variety of occasions.</h2>
</div>

  <div class="contentContainer">
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h4>I took inspiration from a project discussed in UX Strategy (by Jaime Levy). She used http://itsthisforthat.com/ to come up with an idea for a value proposition (“Airbnb for Weddings”). When I tried out the site, I got “1-800 Flowers for Funeral Homes.” I decided to look up 1-800 Flowers to see if the value proposition had any merit. After visiting 1800flowers.com, I felt overwhelmed by the number of options available and imagined that if I were shopping for flowers for a funeral, I would want more direction. From there, I thought to create an app that would provide helpful suggestions for customers shopping for bouquets, and focused on a user flow for purchasing a bouquet for a funeral. <br><br> I also borrowed some inspiration from BuzzFeed quizzes because they are engaging, and if used in an ecommerce environment, they have a tremendous potential to drive traffic by directing shoppers to products that fit their needs and preferences.

  <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
  <h4>After coming up with the basic concept for BestBouquet, I wanted to get a sense of what competition exists and to analyze how they solve for the same or similar problems. If I were to expand my research, I would focus on learning more about how and why people discover and buy bouquets. </h4>
